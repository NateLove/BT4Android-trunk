Set Up
======

This app relies on the ActionBarSherlock Library to use the newer Android 
style guides for Android versions lower than 3.0.

I use Eclipse, so that is how I set this up. If you want to set it up 
differently that is up to you, but please don't attempt to push changes to 
ActionBarSherlock. 

If you are using Eclipse, import both Bt4android folder and ActionBarSherlock 
as Android applications. BT4Android can't be built if ActionBarSherlock is not 
also present. It should work from there, but sometimes it can act strangely 
depending on what version of Android you try to build it from. I usually use 4.1.

Any questions, just let me know. ngl9789@gmail.com
